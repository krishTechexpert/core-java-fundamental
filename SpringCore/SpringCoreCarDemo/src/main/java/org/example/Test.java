       // car.drive();// this.engine" is null because we have not inject dependency injection it means in xml file you have not used any property tag
//-------------------------------------------------------------------

        //--------------------------------------------------------
        /* way-2, But if you want to inject by using constructor
            then used contructor-arg tag  such as
            <constructor-arg name="engine" ref="kseriesId" />

        * if you used both method then setter method will override constructor, As you already know

/*----------- Field Injection
If you want to perform field injection (without using annotations) in Spring XML
(bean.xml), you cannot do it directly like setter injection or constructor injection.
However, you can combine setter injection with reflection to achieve the same effect.

 üìå What is Field Injection?
Field Injection means directly assigning a value to a field (without using a constructor
 or setter method).
Spring does not support field injection through XML directly because XML-based configuration
works with setter and constructor injection.

‚õî Why Doesn't Spring Support Field Injection via XML?

In XML, Spring can only call methods (setters or constructors).
Field injection requires direct access to private variables, which is not possible in XML-based injection.
Solution? We still use setter injection, but we remove the setter method in Java and use reflection.

‚úÖ Workaround: Using Reflection for Field Injection
Since XML doesn't support direct field injection, you can remove setter methods and
allow Spring to inject dependencies using reflection.


package org.example;

//üîπ Step 1: Define Dependency Class (Engine)

public class Engine {
    private String type = "K-Series Engine"; // Field to be injected

    public String getType() {
        return type;
    }
}

üîπ Step 2: Define Main Class (Car) Without Setter
package org.example;

public class Car {
    private Engine engine; // Field injection (No Setter or Constructor)

    public void showEngine() {
        System.out.println("Engine Type: " + engine.getType());
    }
}

üîπ Step 3: Configure bean.xml (Use property for Field Injection)
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
       http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd">

    <!-- Define Engine Bean -->
    <bean id="engineBean" class="org.example.Engine" />

    <!-- Inject Engine into Car (Even without setter) -->
    <bean id="carBean" class="org.example.Car">
        <property name="engine" ref="engineBean" />
    </bean>

</beans>

üîπ Step 4: Run Spring Application
import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext;
import org.springframework.context.support.ClassPathXmlApplicationContext;

public class App {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("bean.xml");

        Car car = (Car) context.getBean("carBean"); // Get Car bean
        car.showEngine(); // Should print "Engine Type: K-Series Engine"
    }
}

üîç How is Field Injection Happening Here?
Spring uses reflection to directly inject the engine variable even though there's no setter method.
This happens because Spring internally uses reflection to access private fields during property injection.
It behaves like field injection but still follows setter injection internally.

/*
* üí° Key Takeaways
‚úî Spring does not support direct field injection via XML.
‚úî Instead, Spring uses setter injection under the hood, even without setter methods (via reflection).
‚úî Use property tag in XML to achieve the same effect as field injection.
‚úî It‚Äôs better to use constructor or setter injection instead of forcing field injection.
