//üö® Issue: The same Engine instance is used for both cars!
//Even though engineBean is a prototype,
// it was only created once at the time of Car's creation.


/*üîπ What is the Problem?

Issue:	The same Engine instance is used every time.
Why It Happens? : 	Car is a singleton, so it gets only one instance of Engine at creation time. evenif you called Car meny times but only one instance will create. due to singleton nature
------------------------------------------------
Issue: Prototype scope is ignored after injection.
Why It Happens? : Constructor injection happens only once when the Car bean is created.
------------------------------------------------
Issue: Every time drive() is called, it uses the same Engine.
Why It Happens? : Prototype beans need to be fetched dynamically, but constructor injection does not support this.

//‚úÖ Solution: Lookup Method Injection /Factory Method injection


//Output
/*
* A new Engine instance is created!
Car instance created with Engine
Engine is starting...
Car is driving...
----
Engine is starting...
Car is driving...
