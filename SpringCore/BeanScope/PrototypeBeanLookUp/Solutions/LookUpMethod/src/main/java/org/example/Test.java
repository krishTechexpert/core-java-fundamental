/*
* Spring now calls getEngine() dynamically to fetch a new Engine instance each time.
Lookup method injection ensures that a new prototype bean is returned whenever needed.
Spring overrides getEngine() dynamically to always return a fresh instance.

*
üéØ Final Thoughts
Without Lookup Method Injection ‚Üí The singleton Car always gets the same Engine instance.
With Lookup Method Injection ‚Üí A new Engine instance is provided every time drive() is called.
