//-------- What is Dependency Injection (DI)
/*
* The process of injecting one class object into another object is called DI.
* In other words,
* Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern used in Java to reduce tight coupling
* between classes. It allows one class to receive its dependencies from an external
* source rather than creating them itself.

*
 * we can perform DI in 3 ways:
*   a.) setter injection
*   b.) constructor injection
*   c.) field injection
* */

// we already make lot of demo about DI . please check it DI folder in Basic
