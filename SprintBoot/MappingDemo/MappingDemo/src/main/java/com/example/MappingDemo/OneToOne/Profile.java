/*
* üí° Conclusion
@OneToOne(mappedBy = "profile") is not required,
* but it prevents redundant foreign keys and ensures clean schema design.

If you don't use mappedBy,
* Hibernate will add an extra column in the Profile table, which is unnecessary.
This is redundant because a One-to-One relationship needs only one foreign key.


üëâ Best Practice? ‚úÖ Always use mappedBy for bidirectional One-to-One relationships.
üöÄ Use mappedBy = "profile" in Profile to prevent unnecessary foreign keys in the database.

üéØ Key Takeaways

Scenario	          Foreign Keys Created	                            Best Practice?

‚ùå Without mappedBy	  passport_id (in Person) + person_id (in Passport)	    ‚ùå No

‚úÖ With mappedBy	        passport_id (in Person only)	                    ‚úÖ Yes

üëâ Always use mappedBy in One-to-One bidirectional relationships to prevent extra columns in the database.

/*------------ IMP Points -------------

If you want to ensure that when a Profile is deleted, the associated Student should also be deleted, then you need to handle this explicitly.

Key Points:
By default, the foreign key is stored in the Student table (profile_id column).

Since Student is the owner of the relationship (@JoinColumn is in Student), deleting Profile alone will not automatically remove the reference from Student.

Solution: Use orphanRemoval = true or manually delete the Student when deleting Profile.
------------------------------------
‚úÖ Solution 1: Use orphanRemoval = true
Hibernate provides orphan removal, which means if the child entity (Profile) is removed, the parent (Student) will be updated to remove the reference.

@Entity
public class Student {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private long id;

    @OneToOne(cascade = CascadeType.ALL, orphanRemoval = true) // ‚úÖ Ensures FK removal in Student when Profile is deleted
    @JoinColumn(name="profile_id", referencedColumnName = "id")
    private Profile profile;
}

@Entity
public class Profile {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private long id;

    @OneToOne(mappedBy = "profile")
    private Student student;
}

How orphanRemoval = true Works?
If you remove the Profile from Student,
the profile_id foreign key will be removed from the Student table automatically.

But it does not delete the Student itself‚Äîonly the reference
(profile_id is set to NULL in the Student table).
---------------------------------------------------

‚úÖ Solution 2: Manually Delete the Student When Profile is Deleted
If you want to delete the Student when the Profile is deleted,
you need to manually handle it.
