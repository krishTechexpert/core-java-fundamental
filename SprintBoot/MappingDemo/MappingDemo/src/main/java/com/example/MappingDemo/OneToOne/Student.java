* 1 student has 1 profile
* 1 profile belong to only 1 student

* another example: 1 country- has -1 prime minster

* Think about a Person and their Passport:

Each Person has only one Passport.

Each Passport belongs to only one Person.

In a database, we model this using a One-to-One relationship.
