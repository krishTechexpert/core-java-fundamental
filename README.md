OOP Principles in Simple Words
1️⃣ Encapsulation (Data Hiding) – Keep data private and allow access through getter and setter methods.
2️⃣ Abstraction (Hiding Complexity) – Show only what’s needed and hide unnecessary details.
3️⃣ Inheritance (Code Reusability) – A class inherits properties and behaviors from another class.
4️⃣ Polymorphism (Flexibility) – One method behaves differently based on the object that calls it.
