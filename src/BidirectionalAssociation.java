* ----------- Bidirectional Association -----------
*
* Associations can be unidirectional (one object knows about another) or
* bidirectional (both objects know about each other).

* //Example: A Library and Books (Bidirectional Association)
*
* In this code, bidirectional association means that:

A Library knows about its Books (through List<Book> books).
A Book knows about its Library (through private Library library).
