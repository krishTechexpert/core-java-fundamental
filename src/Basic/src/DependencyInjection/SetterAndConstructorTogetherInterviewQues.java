/*
*
* Can We Perform Both Setter Injection (SI) and Constructor Injection (CI) for a Single Variable?
Yes, we can perform both (SI) and  (CI) for the same variable (e.g., Engine eng).
*  However, it's generally not recommended because it creates ambiguity about which
* method should be used to inject the dependency.

*
* ðŸš¨ Why This is Not Recommended?
Inconsistent state â€“ If someone uses both CI and SI, itâ€™s unclear which should take priority.
Breaks immutability â€“ Constructor-injected dependencies should ideally be final and immutable.
Confusion in frameworks (e.g., Spring) â€“ It may lead to unexpected behavior if both constructor and setter are used.
