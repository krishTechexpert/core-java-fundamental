/*
When to Use Composition?
        âœ” When one class cannot exist without another (e.g., Car HAS-A Engine).
        âœ” When you need strong dependency between objects.
        âœ” When object encapsulation is required to hide details.
        âœ” When inheritance (IS-A) would make the system too rigid.

ðŸ’¡ Final Thought: Prefer Aggregation when possible to keep flexibility,
but use Composition when objects are strongly dependent on each other.
