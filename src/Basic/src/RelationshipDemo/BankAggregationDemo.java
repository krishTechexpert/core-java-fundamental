/*‚ùå Why is this NOT Composition?

Employee is passed from outside, not created inside Bank constructor.
Bank does not own Employee (If Bank is destroyed, Employee still exists).
This is Aggregation, not Composition.

üí° Final Thought: Prefer Aggregation when possible to keep flexibility,
but use Composition when objects are strongly dependent on each other.
