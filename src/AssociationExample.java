//-------- What is Association?-----------

/*
https://github.com/ashishps1/awesome-low-level-design/tree/main/oop/java/association
* Association defines a connection between two classes, where one class is linked to another.
* The association can be one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, or many-to-many.
* Objects in an association can exist independently of each other.
*
* Key Characteristics of Association:
    Represents a uses-a or knows-a relationship.
    Objects in an association can exist independently.
    Can be unidirectional or bidirectional.
    Promotes modularity and code reusability.

/*
* Types of Association

* 1. One-to-One Association
Each object of class A is associated with one object of class B.
Example: A Person has one Passport/one pancard., A country have one PM

* 2. One-to-Many Association
One object of class A can be associated with multiple objects of class B.
Example: A Teacher teaches multiple Students., PM instruct to all CM, A cricketer play with many teams

* 3. Many-to-One Association
Multiple objects of class A can be associated with one object of class B.
Example: Multiple Students belong to one School., all CM/PM comes into Sadn and speak infront of Loksabha speaker
multiple account(FB,insta,twiter belongs to one user(with same id)
*
* 4. Many-to-Many Association
Multiple objects of class A can be associated with multiple objects of class B.
Example: Teachers and Students (a student can have multiple teachers, and a teacher can have multiple students).

* ðŸ“Œ Real-World Example:
A student can enroll in multiple courses.
A course can have multiple students.
Student has a List<Course>, meaning a student can enroll in multiple courses.
Course has a List<Student>, meaning a course can have multiple students.

// Associations can be unidirectional (one object knows about another but not vice versa) or
// bidirectional (both objects know about each other).
